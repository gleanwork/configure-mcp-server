# Contributing to @gleanwork/mcp-server

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Glean MCP Server! This document provides guidelines and instructions for development.

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gleanwork/mcp-server.git
cd mcp-server
```

1. Ensure `node` and `pnpm` are installed. This project has a built-in
   [mise](http://mise.jdx.dev/) config file that you can use if you'd like
   (though it is not required):

```
mise trust
mise install
```

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

1. Build the project:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

1. Run tests:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Repo Organization

The repository is structured as a monorepo with the following packages:

- `@gleanwork/configure-mcp-server` a tool for configuring popular MCP clients to use Glean.
- `@gleanwork/local-mcp-server` the stdio MCP server that exposes Glean APIs to local assistants.
- `@gleanwork/mcp-server-utils` a collection of utilities used by both the configure tool and local mcp server.

## Running the Server Locally

The server communicates via stdio, making it ideal for integration with AI models and other tools:

```bash
node packages/local-server/build/index.js
```

Input and output follow the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol, with each message on a new line.

## Documentation

### Running Documentation Locally
